# Filament

## Description
**Filament** is an iOS-based remote control app. The remote may be used to control lights, heat, a speaker system, and doors/locks in numerous rooms. It is usable by people who are completely blind, using the iPhone's built-in VoiceOver screen reader, people who are completely sighted using the visual interface, and people with low vision due to the colour and font size choices.

## What Worked Well/What Could Be Improved  
Our teamwork made this project a lot easier, so that is one thing that worked extremely well. Two team members were working on the actual iOS app, while the other two worked on the writeup, but everyone was actively contributing to design choices. We all had similar ideas about the implementation of the app, which made finalizing details easy.  

Since we had around an hour to build the app in class, we forgot some details, such as a back buttom. If we could start over, one thing we would change would be to spend a bit more time on the storyboard in the beginning so we can make sure we have all details completely finalized. We also would want to make the visual interface slightly more appealing, through the use of icons like the ones pictured in one of our original sketches.
