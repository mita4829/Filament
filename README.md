# Filament

## Description
**Filament** is a smartphone based remote control. The remote may be used to control several home appliances and smarthome elements (like a smart thermostat or smart light bulbs). It is usable by someone who is totally blind, using your phone's built in screen reader, and is also usable by someone who is sighted. **Filament** is aimed to support someone with low vision, by using large text and high contrast.

## What Worked Well/What Could Be Improved  
Teamwork definitely made everything a lot easier, so that would be one thing that worked extremely well. One of us was working on the actual iOS app, while another worked on the writeup, while another worked on the README, etc. We all had similar ideas about the implementation of the app, which made finalizing details easy.  

Since we only had around an hour to build the app, we forgot some details, a back button being one of them. If we could start over, one thing we would change would be to spend a bit more time on the storyboard in the beginning so we can make sure we have all details completely finalized.
