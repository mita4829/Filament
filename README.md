# Filament

## Description
**Filament** is a smartphone based remote control. The remote may be used to control several home appliances and smarthome elements (like a smart thermostat or smart light bulbs). It is usable by someone who is totally blind, using your phone's built in screen reader, and is also usable by someone who is sighted. **Filament** is aimed to support someone with low vision, by using large text and high contrast.
